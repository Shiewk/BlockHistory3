# BlockHistory

A simple but effective Paper Minecraft plugin that allows you to find griefers on your server more easily.

This plugin can help you find griefers more easily. The plugin saves when a block is broken or placed. That way you can easily see who broke or placed blocks.

## Usage
Install the plugin on your server, and it will start to track every block's history.

### Block history command
Then, if you need to view the history of a block, run **[/blockhistory history \<x> \<y> \<z>](https://github.com/Shiewk/BlockHistory3/blob/main/docs/commands.md)**. This will display the history of the block. It should look like this:

![BlockHistory history command chat output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a89e2eb2-f34e-4834-98b3-412ca19c8f25)

This way, you can easily see changes like someone destroying your builds etc.

### Stats command

You can use the **[/blockhistory stats](https://github.com/Shiewk/BlockHistory3/blob/main/docs/commands.md)** command to see statistics about the plugin's disk usage and uptime. This is what the command's output looks like:
